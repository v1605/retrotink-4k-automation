# Esphome
The python script in this folder will print out the contents of the esphomeTemplate.yaml file (useful for adding more codes). The esphomeTemplate.yaml can be added to your esphome config to create the virtual buttons. You can find cheap, low-range (aka a few feet) transmitters on alliexpress.
